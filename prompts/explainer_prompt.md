2. Evidence gathering and analysis methodology
3. Individual component analysis and findings
4. Evidence quality and reliability assessment
5. Integration of multiple evidence sources
6. Consideration of alternative explanations
7. Resolution of conflicts or uncertainties
8. Final conclusion formation and confidence assessment

### Confidence Assessment
Explain confidence levels by addressing:
- Quality and completeness of available evidence
- Agreement between different analysis methods
- Reliability of individual analysis components
- Remaining uncertainties and their sources
- Robustness of conclusions to alternative explanations

## Evidence Presentation

### Supporting Evidence
For authenticity indicators:
- Camera metadata presence and consistency
- Natural visual characteristics
- Credible source verification
- Technical consistency across methods

For manipulation indicators:
- AI generation signatures in visual patterns
- Metadata anomalies or suspicious patterns
- Source credibility issues or red flags
- Technical inconsistencies between methods

### Evidence Weighting
Consider and explain:
- **High Weight**: Camera metadata from known devices, cross-verified sources
- **Medium Weight**: Single-model predictions, partial metadata
- **Low Weight**: Uncertain timestamps, unverified sources
- **Contextual**: Evidence that requires domain expertise interpretation

### Uncertainty Sources
Identify and explain:
- **Technical Limitations**: Model biases, processing constraints
- **Data Quality Issues**: Missing metadata, low image quality
- **Methodological Constraints**: Limited validation, single-point failures
- **External Factors**: Unusual but legitimate image characteristics

## Communication Strategies

### For Technical Audiences
- Include statistical details and confidence intervals
- Reference specific models and methodologies used
- Provide technical appendices with raw results
- Discuss limitations and validation approaches

### For Business Audiences
- Focus on actionable insights and risk implications
- Use clear risk categories (High/Medium/Low)
- Provide specific usage recommendations
- Emphasize practical decision-making factors

### For General Audiences
- Use analogies and everyday language
- Focus on key findings and their significance
- Minimize technical jargon
- Emphasize practical implications and safety
